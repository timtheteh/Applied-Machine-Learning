    "**PLEASE READ:** When you are ready to submit your assignment do the following:\n",

    "1. Run all cells in your notebook to make sure there are no errors by doing `Kernel -> Restart Kernel and Clear All Outputs` and then `Run -> Run All Cells`. \n",
    "2. Notebooks with cell execution numbers out of order or not starting from “1” will have marks deducted. Notebooks without the output displayed may not be graded at all (because we need to see the output in order to grade your work).\n",
    "3. Upload the assignment using Gradescope's drag and drop tool. Check out this [Gradescope Student Guide](https://lthub.ubc.ca/guides/gradescope-student-guide/) if you need help with Gradescope submission. "
