## Important information regarding the upcoming CPSC 330 Midterm
As per calendar, the midterm will be on Wednesday, February 15, from 7:00pm to 8:15pm (exam is 75 minutes long). No remote options allowed. 
 
The in-person exam will be closed-book and it will be administered through Canvas. Students will attend to the exam location based on the lecture section they are officially registered in. 

**Please see locations below:**

- CPSC 330 Section 201 students (taught by Giulia Toti) will write the exam in [SCRF 100](https://learningspaces.ubc.ca/classrooms/scrf-100)
- CPSC 330 Section 202 students (taught by Mathias Lecuyer) will write the exam in [ESB 1012](https://learningspaces.ubc.ca/classrooms/esb-1012)
- CPSC 330 Section 203 students (taught by Amir Abdi) will write the exam in [DMP 310](https://learningspaces.ubc.ca/classrooms/dmp-310)

You are required to bring your own computer or tablet to complete the exam (no smartphones or other devices allowed). If you do not think you will have one available on the day of the exam, please let your CPSC 330 Course Coordinator, Michelle know no later than this Friday, February 10 by sending an email to cpsc330-admin@cs.ubc.ca. If you come to the exam without a computer, or if your computer malfunctions during the exam, you will be offered a paper version of the test.
 
You do not need to bring anything else to the test: scrap paper will be provided and a basic calculator is accessible in Canvas.
 
You are also required to bring your UBC student card or another piece or photo ID for identification. If we are unable to verify your identity because you do not have a valid ID, your exam will be invalidated and you will be assigned a grade of 0.
 
Students who require special accommodations must register with CFA and take the exam at their facilities. Remember that CFA requires you to do so at least 1 week prior to the exam, so do this ASAP. If you fail to register with CFA and can not take the exam with them, we will not be able to provide alternative accommodations and you will have to take the exam with the rest of the class.
 
Lastly, we will connect with those who has submitted a MT conflict shortly after the request deadline.

The teaching team can (must) be contacted through Piazza. All info about how to contact us can be found [here](https://github.com/UBC-CS/cpsc330-2022W2/blob/main/docs/asking_for_help.md)

**Course Coordinator**:
- Michelle Pang

The Course Coordinator can be contacted through email at cpsc330-admin@cs.ubc.ca. Please note that the Course Coordinator's work hours are 8:30 AM-4:30 PM Monday to Friday. They do not respond to emails outside of their work hours and their response time varies, especially during extra busy times (e.g., before the add/drop deadline). In general, you can expect a response in 3-5 business days.

## Registration

**Waitlists**:

The general seats available in this class usually fill up very quickly. 
Once the general seats are taken, the only way to register for the course is to sign up for the waiting list. For questions about the waiting list policies, see [here](https://www.cs.ubc.ca/students/undergrad/courses/waitlists). You should sign up for the waiting list even if it is long; a lot of students tend to drop courses. Signing up for the waiting list also makes it more likely that we will open up extra sessions, expand class sizes, or offer additional courses on these topics. I have no control over the situation and I cannot help you bypass the waiting list.

**Prerequisites**: The official prerequisites can be found [here](https://courses.students.ubc.ca/cs/courseschedule?tname=subj-course&course=330&campuscd=UBC&dept=CPSC&pname=subjarea). If you do not meet the prerequisites, see [here](https://www.cs.ubc.ca/students/undergrad/courses-deadlines/prerequisites) and [here](https://www.cs.ubc.ca/students/undergrad/courses-deadlines/rules-about-cpsc-appeals-undergraduate-students). I was told that students should not visit the front desk in the CS main office about prerequisite issues, because the folks at the front desk do not have the authority to resolve prerequisite issues.

In practice, the prerequisite is familiarity with Python programming.

**Auditing**: If the course is full, we cannot accommodate official auditors. If there is space and you would like to audit the course, please contact the instructor. All UBC students are welcome to audit the course unofficially. 

## Grading
 
The grading scheme for the course is as follows:

| Component   | Weight          | Location   |
|-------------|-----------------|------------|
| Syllabus quiz |   1%          | [Canvas](https://canvas.ubc.ca/courses/106375/quizzes/584868) | 
| Assignments |     30%         | [Gradescope](https://www.gradescope.ca/courses/9483) |
| Midterm     |     19%         | TBD |
| Final       |     50%         | TBD   |

**A score of at least 50% in the Final Exam is required to pass the course.**

Assignments will contribute equally towards the overall Assignments grade. This may change only in case the last assignment ends up particularly short or long due to timing, in which case the weight will be changed accordingly. Furthermore, I will drop your lowest homework grade. 

For the full policy on grades, see [this document](grades.md).

For the grading scheme I wish we could use, see [here](https://youtu.be/HdHlfiOAJyE?t=3771).

## Academic concessions

UBC has a [policy on academic concession](https://senate.ubc.ca/sites/senate.ubc.ca/files/downloads/20190515_V_135_Academic_Concession-Approved.pdf) for cases in which a student may be unable to complete coursework. According to this policy, grounds for academic concession can be illness, conflicting responsibilities, or compassionate grounds. Examples of compassionate grounds, from the above policy, include "a traumatic event experienced by the student, a family member, or a close friend; an act of sexual assault or other sexual misconduct experienced by the student, a family member, or a close friend; a death in the family or of a close friend." If you would like to request an academic concession, please fill out the [academic concession form](https://github.com/UBC-CS/cpsc330/blob/master/docs/ConcessionForm.pdf) and email it to the Michelle, your CPSC 330 course coordinator at cpsc330-admin@cs.ubc.ca as soon as possible. You may be asked for further documentation. The instructor will evaluate the situation and make a decision on whether to grant the concession and, if so, how to proceed.

## Midterm

The midterm exam will take place on **February 15, 2023** at 7PM. Note that this is **outside of regular class time**. More details about the midterm will follow as we get closer to the date.

**Missed midterm exam**. There is no makeup midterm exam. If you miss the midterm exam, or anticipate missing the midterm exam, please see the Academic concessions section above. In most cases, if you have missed the midterm exam for a justified reason, the weight of the midterm component of the course will be transferred to the final exam.


## Final exam

The final exam will be held on Thursday, April 20th 2023 at 7 pm (Location: TBD). **Do not book flights/trips before you are sure they do not conflict with the date of the final**.

## Code of conduct

- If you plan to engage in non-course-related activity in lecture (Facebook, YouTube, chatting with friends, etc), please sit in the last row of the room to avoid distracting your classmates.
- Do not distribute any course materials (slides, homework assignments, solutions, notes, etc.) without permission.
- Do not photograph or record lectures (audio or video) without permission.
- If you have a problem or complaint, let the instructor(s) know immediately. Maybe we can fix it!

## Regarding the COVID-19 global pandemic

**Masks:** This class is going to be in person. Masks are no longer required indoors at UBC, but they are welcomed and encouraged. 

**Vaccination:** If you have not yet had a chance to get vaccinated against COVID-19, vaccines are available to you, free, and on campus [http://www.vch.ca/covid-19/covid-19-vaccine]. The higher the rate of vaccination in our community overall, the lower the chance of spreading this virus.  You are an important part of the UBC community. Please arrange to get vaccinated if you have not already done so.

**Your personal health:**
If you're sick, it's important that you stay home – no matter what you think you may be sick with (e.g., cold, flu, other). A daily self-health assessment is required before attending campus. Every day, before leaving home, complete the self-assessment for COVID symptoms using [this tool](https://bc.thrive.health/covid19/en ).

Stay home if you have COVID symptoms, have recently tested positive for COVID, or are required to quarantine. You can check [this website](http://www.bccdc.ca/health-info/diseases-conditions/covid-19/self-isolation#Who) to find out if you should self-isolate or self-monitor. 

**If sick on an exam day:**
If you are feeling unwell and are unable to attend your exam, please contact the course coordinator (cpsc330-admin@cs.ubc.ca) ahead of time with **your full name and student number**. We will work with you to make alternate arrangements for you to complete the exam. It is important to take care of your health and well-being, so if you are feeling ill, it is best not to attend the exam in person.

If you are sick on a final exam day, **do not attend the exam**. You must apply for deferred standing (an academic concession) through Science Advising no later than 48 hours after the missed final exam/assignment. Students who are granted deferred standing write the final exam/assignment at a later date. Learn more and find the application online: https://science.ubc.ca/students/advising/concession     

For additional information about academic concessions, see the UBC policy here:http://www.calendar.ubc.ca/vancouver/index.cfm?tree=3,329,0,0

## Land Acknowledgement 

UBC’s Point Grey Campus is located on the traditional, ancestral, and unceded territory of the xwməθkwəy̓əm (Musqueam) people. The land it is situated on has always been a place of learning for the Musqueam people, who for millennia have passed on their culture, history, and traditions from one generation to the next on this site.

It’s important that this recognition of Musqueam territory and our relationship with the Musqueam people does not appear as just a formality. Take a moment to appreciate the meaning behind the words we use:

**TRADITIONAL** recognizes lands traditionally used and/or occupied by the Musqueam people or other First Nations in other parts of the country.

**ANCESTRAL** recognizes land that is handed down from generation to generation.

**UNCEDED** refers to land that was not turned over to the Crown (government) by a treaty or other agreement.

As you begin your journey at UBC, take some time to learn about the history of this land and to honour its original inhabitants.
